# SpiderButt
SpiderButt is a collection of tweaks and bugfixes for The Legend of Bum-Bo. It is also the (extremely humble) beginnings of a Mod API for the game. The API is still under heavy development, and it is likely it will never be finished, but I have released SpiderButt in its current state so the tweaks can be publicly used.

Current tweaks:
* Jackpot changes have been backported from 1.0.5, so the reduction is 5% and the lower bound is 40%
* "New Game" acts as a quick restart button
* "Exit Game" quits to the main menu instead of closing the game entirely
